A cli tool to compare two postgres databases. Given two databases, one
it considers truth and one to test against, pg-compare will compare the
following items and verify theyâ€™re identical on both databases. -
database catalogs - tables - columns in each table - indexes - primary
keys - row counts

Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Clone this repo
2. ``pip install .``

    $ pg-compare --help
    Usage: pg-compare [OPTIONS]

      This is used to compare two databases. Takes two connection strings. One
      it considers truth and another to test against it. Used to determine the
      difference in two databases.

    Options:
      -a, --truthdb TEXT              Connection string for database to consider
                                      truth.
      -b, --testdb TEXT               Connection string for database to test.
      -e, --everything                Run all comparisons.
      -s, --select [catalogs|columns|indexes|pks|rowcounts|tables]
                                      Select specific comparisons to run.
      -o, --outfile PATH              Specify a csv file to be created for failed
                                      comparisons.
      -d, --debug                     Show a table of database connection info.
      --help                          Show this message and exit.
